Stars sway and shatter on the Midnight Moon, 
Their trails scintillate, shaken by eternal winds.

Past infinite ocean bays, stretch these pillars of ancient trees
With thousands of centuries are tattooed on their innards.

The Moon, veiled in a perennial dusk, 
Has not forests thriving on sunlight,
Nor on the milky beams of the Moon but 
These trees flourish from the plasma of the winding rivers of the soul
From boundless distant lives, light millenniums apart.


In shaded gardens of the universe’s overgrowth,
Through blazing coronas and the scattered sands of galaxies,
Stretches the forest of the Midnight Moon in effervescent brilliance
Reflected in the luminous glimmers of Earth’s auroras.
